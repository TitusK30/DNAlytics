# DNAlytics

DNAlytics is a Medical Information System (MIS) that is designed to offer a real-time Molecular Diagnostic Dashboard with a Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) training simulator. This training simulator will be a web-based educational simulator used in pathology labs in order to train Medical Laboratory Science students on the computer software used to run a hospital’s Pathology Lab and will also operate to send diagnostic information to the patient’s physician. This training dashboard will include quality control, patient entry, progress of results, patient reports, training videos, assignments, quizzes, case studies, and a gradebook. The goal of DNAlytics is to provide a training software that simulates real-world workflow conditions to help students enhance their clinical diagnostic understanding, remove any discrepancy in laboratory analysis knowledge, and minimize any detrimental healthcare events. As stated previously, DNAlytics focuses on Molecular Diagnostics and will be used in the Molecular department of the LIS training simulator. Molecular Diagnostic testing involves studying DNA and RNA sequences to detect diseases, including inherited conditions, cancers, and infectious diseases. DNAlytics will serve as  a critical tool for the Health Science Center, providing students with hands-on experience using an interactive dashboard tailored to molecular diagnostics.
